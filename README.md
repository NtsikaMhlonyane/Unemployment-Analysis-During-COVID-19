# Unemployment Analysis during COVID-19 

## Overview
The Unemployment Analysis Project is aimed at analyzing unemployment rates across different regions over a specific time period. This project involves data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, statistical analysis, and conclusion drawing.

## Data
The dataset used for this analysis contains information about unemployment rates, employment figures, and labor participation rates for various regions. The data is collected monthly and covers a specific time period. The dataset consists of the following columns:

- **Region**: The region where the data was collected.
- **Date**: The date of data collection.
- **Frequency**: The frequency of data collection (e.g., monthly).
- **Estimated Unemployment Rate (%)**: The estimated unemployment rate for the corresponding date and region.
- **Estimated Employed**: The estimated number of employed individuals.
- **Estimated Labour Participation Rate (%)**: The estimated labor participation rate.
- **Area**: Specifies whether the data represents rural or urban areas.

## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the dataset, handle missing values, and ensure data consistency.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore the dataset to understand distributions, trends, and correlations between variables.
3. **Visualization**: Create visualizations such as line plots, bar charts, and heatmaps to represent the data effectively.
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Conduct statistical tests to validate observations or hypotheses, such as t-tests or ANOVA.
5. **Conclusion**: Summarize key findings and insights derived from the analysis.
